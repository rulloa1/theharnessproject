## 💬 Example Interaction

**User**: "What is PrEP?"

**Lil Z**: 
> **What is PrEP?**
> 
> PrEP (Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis) is a game-changer! It's a daily medication that prevents HIV infection BEFORE exposure. When taken consistently, PrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV from sex by about 99%. It's one of the most powerful prevention tools we have today. Think of it as your daily shield! 🛡️💊
