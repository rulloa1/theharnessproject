# ⚠️ WORDPRESS FILES STATUS & ACTION PLAN

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Issue:** WordPress upload folder doesn't exist yet  
**Status:** Files need to be uploaded to WordPress

---

## 🎯 CURRENT SITUATION

The HTML pages are **ready and updated** with links to:
```
https://www.theharnessproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/[filename]
```

**BUT:** These files haven't been uploaded to WordPress yet!

---

## 📋 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

### **Option 1: Upload Files to WordPress (Recommended)**

You have the content ready. You need to upload these 21 files to your WordPress site:

#### **Step 1: Access WordPress Admin**
1. Go to: `https://www.theharnessproject.org/wp-admin`
2. Log in with your WordPress credentials

#### **Step 2: Upload Files**
1. Go to **Media** → **Add New**
2. Upload all 21 files (listed below)
3. WordPress will create the upload folder automatically
4. Files will be accessible at the URLs we've already linked

#### **Step 3: Verify Upload Path**
WordPress default upload path is:
```
/wp-content/uploads/YEAR/MONTH/
```

For January 2026, it should be:
```
/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/
```

This matches the links we've already created!

## 🔄 OPTION 2: TEMPORARY SOLUTION (Host Files Here)

If WordPress isn't available yet, we can **host the files directly in this project** temporarily:

### **Create a downloads folder:**
```
/downloads/
  ├── Quick_Start_Kit.pdf
  ├── READ_ME_FIRST.pdf
  ├── Curriculum_and_Lesson_Plans.pdf
  ├── Facilitators_Guide_Detailed.pdf
  ├── Participant_Workbook.pdf
  ├── Main_Slides.pdf
  ├── Main_Slides.pptx
  └── ... (all 21 files)
```

### **Then update ALL links from:**
```html
<!-- OLD -->
https://www.theharnessproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/[filename]

<!-- NEW -->
downloads/[filename]
```

**Would you like me to:**
1. ✅ Create a `/downloads/` folder structure
2. ✅ Update all links to use local downloads
3. ✅ Create placeholder files showing what goes where

---

## 🔄 OPTION 3: USE GOOGLE DRIVE / DROPBOX

If you have files on Google Drive or Dropbox:

### **Google Drive:**
1. Upload files to Google Drive
2. Right-click → Get link → Anyone with the link can view
3. Use direct download links
4. I'll update all pages with those links

### **Dropbox:**
1. Upload files to Dropbox
2. Get shareable link
3. Change `?dl=0` to `?dl=1` for direct download
4. I'll update all pages

## ❓ WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

### **Tell me:**

**Option A:** "Upload to WordPress"
- I'll wait while you upload files
- Then we verify links work
- Everything stays as-is

**Option B:** "Host files locally in this project"
- I'll create `/downloads/` folder
- Update all links to local files
- You upload files to that folder

**Option C:** "Use Google Drive/Dropbox"
- Share the links with me
- I'll update all HTML pages
- Quick and easy

**Option D:** "I have the files elsewhere"
- Tell me where they are
- I'll update links accordingly

## 🚨 CURRENT STATUS

✅ All updated and ready  
✅ Professional design complete

## 💡 RECOMMENDED ACTION

**Best approach:**

1. **If you have WordPress access:** Upload all 21 files via WordPress Media Library
2. **If WordPress isn't set up:** Tell me, and I'll create a local `/downloads/` folder solution
3. **If files are on Google Drive:** Share links and I'll update everything

## 🎯 WHAT I NEED FROM YOU

Please tell me:

1. **Do you have WordPress admin access?**
   - Yes → I'll guide you through upload
   - No → We'll use alternative

2. **Where are your 21 PDF/PPTX files currently?**
   - On your computer → Need upload solution
   - Google Drive → Share links
   - Dropbox → Share links
   - Somewhere else → Tell me where

3. **What do you want to do?**
   - Upload to WordPress (best)
   - Host locally in this project
   - Use cloud storage links
   - Something else

---

**Once you tell me, I'll immediately update all the links to match your chosen solution!** 🚀

**Status:** Waiting for your direction on where to host the files  
**Current:** HTML pages ready, download links point to non-existent WordPress folder
